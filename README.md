# ðŸ§  Body Performance Project

## ðŸ“„ Overview
This project analyzes the **Body Performance dataset** to explore relationships between various physical attributes (such as height, weight, age, and BMI) and performance indicators.  
The notebook includes **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization**, and **machine learning modeling** to understand factors affecting body performance.
